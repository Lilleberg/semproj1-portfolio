        <p class="p1">As we learn more and more of the impact humans are
          having on the planet, the more important it
          becomes that
          scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just
          for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
        <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
          currently face including global warming,
          extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the
          positive ways we can all contribute to a
          brighter
          future.</p>

        <img src="images/robots.png" alt="robot heads">
        <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future.
          From
          useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics,
          the future is here. You can even say hello and
          shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <img src="images/moon_phases.jpg" alt="image of moon phases">
        <p class="p1">Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
          exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the
          night
          sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
          We’ll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early
          navigators who used the stars to travel by.</p>
        <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
          traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
          exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <img src="images/evolution.png"
          alt="silhouette of evolution of humans">
        <p class="p1">For centuries, philosophers and scientists have
          wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
          do
          we come
          from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of
          evolution we have had a framework for
          exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
        <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
          we know today have evolved our time. You can
          also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t
          survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
          Dodos,
          and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

      <section class="biomed">
        <h2>Biology and Medicin</h2>
        <img src="images/dna.png" alt="silhouette of dna">
        <p class="p1">From micro-organisms to the human body, major
          breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
          insights into the
          great wonders of the tiny world. </p>
        <p class="p2">For many people their life expectancy is much longer
          and their quality of life much improved,
          thanks
          to the
          growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of
          exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
          take
          a
          look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
          penicillin and the first heart transplant. </p>
        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from
          the lab, but also from observing animals in
          the
          wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
